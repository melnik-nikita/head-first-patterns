## SOLID Principles [Cheat Sheet](http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2014/10/solid.html)

- Single responsibility principle
    - any particular class should have a single reason to change
    - Separation of concerns - different classes handling different, independent tasks/problems
    - [Teplyakov explanation](http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2014/08/single-responsibility-principle.html)
- Open-Closed principle
    - parts of the system or subsystem should be open for extensions but closed for modification
    - [Teplyakov explanation](http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.ca/2014/08/open-closed-principle.html)
- Liskov substitution principle
    - an object (such as a class) and a sub-object (such as a class that extends the first class) must be
      interchangeable without breaking the program
    - [Teplyakov explanation](http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.ca/2014/09/liskov-substitution-principle.html)
- Interface segregation principle
    - no code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use
    - YAGNI - you ain't going to need it
    - [Teplyakov explanation](http://sergeyteplyakov.blogspot.com/2014/08/interface-segregation-principle.html)
- Dependency inversion principle
    - high-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones; it should depend on abstrations
